// BACKSTORY ////////////////////////
/////////////////////////////////////

Player is a cop who trailed a thief from the Arth sector. The thief used some
 sort of wormhole creating artifact to escape and the player followed. Thief
 didn't operate the artifact properly and came through damaged. Hull ruptures,
 ship too small for escape pods, attempts landing on nearby planet, crashes
 and dies.
Player is damaged but has nicer ship and hull ruptures are contained. Ship's in
 terrible shape though, and crossing his/her fingers, player issues a distress
 call.

Ssh is destroyed
About 1000 survive
They travel in time to some thousands of years prior
Hardship transforms them, they become the Soom Fenderit
They develop a prophecy promising an "Era of Justice"
- The "Great Persecutor" or something will come
- The "Great Victim" or something
- Commit "Crime of the Ages"
- "Final Revenge"
Player appears, matches prophetic description
The Fenderit arrange for player to deliver weapon to Ssh



//////////////////////////////////////
// STORY ELEMENTS AND QUESTS /////////
//////////////////////////////////////

Player returns to Luesheen for payment for delivering what we all thought was
 terraforming tech
Fenderit activist shows up in scout vessel warning of hostile fleet approaching
Fight, Luesheen repel hostile fleet, but not before they destroy the scout (for
 player feels)
Luesheen describe the prophecy to player
Player gets means to fly base around
- If player goes to listening post, finds establishment warships there
Eventually Fenderit attack. After this happens the activists make contact.
Somehow player learns that the Fenderit swapped the catalysts
- Activists are aware some evidence has been destroyed, but they aren't sure
  if it's the catalysts. They suggest talking to Kee Pensette.
- Kee Pensette discover their records have been falsified - they didn't get
  what the manufacturer said they got.
- Player gives records to activists, who are able to verify that Fenderit
  authorities are indeed responsible.
It doesn't matter though. Agents use the dirty evidence and ignore all else.
Meanwhile attacks on player base increase in frequency and intensity
- Fleets come and retreat when the going gets tough. They come back
  ever larger and the cycle repeats until a certain number of ships are
  defeated.
Now that the Ssh tragedy has occurred, the Nameless One has regained memory of
 its purpose. It's a monument to a group who fell to the Soom Fenderit sometime
 in the Fenderit's history. It knows the actual story, which had been
 overwritten after this group disappeared. It won't tell the story until it can
 broadcast it everywhere.
Activists ask the player for help destroying the three jamming bases. This will
 allow the Nameless One to broadcast its news.

Ending cutscene or something:
Tensions among the Fenderit populace reach a tipping point.
Revolution starts including an eventual coup.
The cabal disappears.

Afterward:
Side quests are still available
The Luesheen know where the cabal went but won't tell. (They asked for asylum
 among the Luesheen, which was granted.) Justice is irrelevant
 now. They can't do any more harm where they've gone. Trial and punishment
 would be nothing more than revenge at this point. Nothing can be gained by
 further suffering, even if they're the ones who suffer.
 - I see. Maybe you're right.

 - No, if their suffering helps the rest of us find peace, it's worth it.
 - In the long run, peace will be no easier or harder to find.
 - We don't have a "long run". Each of us has maybe a century and that's it. It
   takes generations to heal from a catastrophe like this. Until then we live
   without the resolution justice can bring.
 - A civilization first learns to starve its anger rather than satisfying it.
   Only then does it find peace.

 - I guess I can't argue with that.
 - Of course it's all easier said than done. You're experiencing that first
   hand, and I can only imagine how hard it is.

 - I'm not talking about a civilization. I'm talking about people. You're
   covering for mass murderers but leaving the survivors to fend for
   themselves.
 - I promise you, we do more than meets the eye.
 - OK, what then? What do you do?
 - You would argue if I told you, but then tire of arguing before I
   could satisfy you.
 - Ah, the "It's too complicated" defense.
 - I'm not defending us; I won't ask you to approve. I'm discussing the matter
   hoping you find some sort of satisfaction thereby.

 - I'll never be satisfied and I'm sure I'll never approve. You think you're
   beyond right and wrong, but you're not. The rules apply to you, too.
 - You're mistaken about us. I suppose I can only hope you forgive us
   someday for what must seem like arrogance and condescension.
 - Well not today.

 - I don't think I'll ever be satisfied, unfortunately.
 - As is your choice. Until next time.




/*************************************************************
The War
- Series of fights culminating at the Fenderit homeworld.
- People the player helped without expecting anything in return show up to
  help as a surprise
- Each fight is meant to remove some strength the enemy has. They aren't easy
  to win.
- At each fight, friends will retreat if things are going badly for them. If
  the protagonist retreats, there's a modest chance the battle will be won
  anyway, depending on the number of friends left. But any goodies that fight
  leaves are forfeit.
- Retreating from the final battle is considered a loss, forcing reload.
- Major characters in this chapter
  - Fenderit activist the player worked with earlier
  - Lexy if appropriate
  - Kee Pensette representative group
  - Fenderit activist battle commander
  - Fenderit security officer encountered near Nameless One?
  - A rogue clinkltook? The one from the distress call?
  - Choxx from pirate base?
  - Nameless One?
  - Fecto squadron leader
  - The ship that was out of fuel, if the player helped without payment;
    spent a lot of time souping up the ship and didn't want to miss out?
  - Dweenle kamikazi
- Player is summoned to uninhabited system just outside Fenderit space
  - Everyone's waiting for player there
  - Battle commander puts player in charge of Fecto squadron, Kee Pensette
    squadron, and free agents
- First attack location
  - Shyneum refinery, modest defenses
  - Victory means a flat fuel stipend at the beginning of each remaining
    battle of the war such that the better engines don't use fuel at
    all.
- Second attack location
  - Telecommunications hub, moderate defenses
  - Reward is a large cache of rare materials, and combat bonuses dependent on
    the number of friends in the fight.
- Third attack location
  - Black skunkworks, minimally defended until huge ambush surrounds battalion
  - Reward is some sweet tech
- Final battle
  - Fenderit homeworld, tremendous defenses, other friendly battalions present
  - First skirmish
    - Neutralize great big automated defense node
    - Dweenle attempts kamikazi, misses
  - Second skirmish
    - Hey Dweenle, you're more useful if you fight instead of trying to kill
      yourself. "Oh no, I'm afraid to fight."
    - Destroy fleet of mid-tier battleships
    - Dweenle attempts kamikazi, misses again
  - Third skirmish
    - Destroy super giganto capital ship
    - "What does this button do?" "Why do I hear counting?" Dweenle
      accidentally self-destructs
  - Final cutscene
    - Destroy command center, everyone's involved, Fenderit hopelessly
      outnumbered, they get totally pounded
***************************************************************/


Player shows up in sector looking for the thief who stole a valuable AI
 - Asking around, player eventually gets a tip that the thief was tracked going
   in a certain direction.
 - Player goes in that direction, searching, eventually finding a crashed ship
   with a damaged female android.
 - The android has been programmed to love the thief. The thief is dead and
   she's grieving.
 - The player has three choices: revert the android's programming and use it as
   a member of the crew, leave the android as is and keep it imprisoned on the
   ship, or set it free.
   - To set it free or use it as a member of the crew, player must give it a
     body. This involves some quest to get the necessary help.
   - Using it as a member of the crew requires reprogramming it to be
     compliant. If the player decides to do this, the AI says, "Before you
     reprogram me, let me say this: *I hope you burn in hell*."
   - To set it free, the player must find a ship for it. It's a quest to
     get several components to put together to make the ship.
 - If the player makes the AI a new ship, s/he will get a distress signal at
   some point because the AI is being harassed by pirates.

Player needs ship help
 - Ssh repair ship and give fuel
 - Everyone uses shyneum
 - Choxx pirates use endurium, maybe also shyneum
 - No one else uses endurium because Kee Pensette figured out they're alive
 - Can sometimes find free fuel planetside
 - There's a ton of endurium on the Kee Pensette homeworld, but if player
   takes any of it, Kee Pensette will take it back by force, and they will
   always win the fight.

The Luesheen set the player on a quest to drop probes at specified locations
 in the region so they might match up the energy burst with an accompanying
 event elsewhere in the galaxy.
 - Three probes
 - One is in uninhabited space
 - One is in friendly space
 - One is in very dangerous hostile space - sensitive Soom Fenderit space
 - The Fecto steal one. This makes for another quest.
 - The Soom Fenderit absolutely will not allow access to their location.
 - A neighbor of the Fenderit knows of some sneaky way in.
 - After the player tries to enter but declines to fight, someone comes
   along and tells the player about the person who knows the sneaky way in.
 - The results are useless because there are too many events to tell which
   belongs to the player.
 - But the player gains some nice goodies along the way, making the quest
   worthwhile anyway.

The Fecto steal one of the probes
 - They claim the player doesn't need it. "You don't understand. This is
   extremely important!" "Yes, it is important."
 - Besides, they say it still belongs to the player. It's just that they're
   going to keep it from now on.
 - Discussion about what possession actually means?
 - If player wants to fight, the Fecto say it isn't nearby. There is
   nothing to be gained from fighting.
 - If player attacks, Fecto disappear.
 - Ssh tell player to say some particular weird thing to the Fecto.
 - When the player does this, the Fecto say they put it back. When the
   player checks, it will indeed be there. It will not be there until
   the player says the special thing and goes and checks.
 - When the player visits the probe after it reappears, it is painted in
   bright colors.
 - "But you said I didn't need it, and you were going to keep it from now
   on." "You don't need it, and it will never leave our space."
 - "Why didn't you just tell me you wanted to paint it?" "We didn't want
   to paint it." "OK, why didn't you tell me you were going to paint it?"
   "We weren't going to paint it." "What were you going to do with it?"
   "We were going to please it." "What the hell does that mean?" "It
   means now. (They disappear)"
 - ... "Why did you paint it then?" "We didn't paint it." And if the
   player checks the probe again, they find it is no longer painted. (This is
   an illusion. Not sure whether or how this is ever revealed to
   the player.)
 - If the player returns again to the probe, it will be painted. There will be
   no changes afterward.

Player somehow finds a being of some kind in a cage, starving to death.
 - Player is unable to move or open the cage. Clues lead player to "owner" of
   being.
 - Owner is a Soom Fenderit.
 - Owner can't be bothered, but won't give up the being because owner has
   lawful possession of the being and is also a control freak. Law supports
   owner so there's no legal recourse for player. Owner won't allow player to
   help because of pride and can't be bothered.
 - In fact there's nothing the player can do. At some point the being dies. The
   owner gets away with it.
 - There is a sequence allowing the player to get revenge.
 - Owner begs for life. Player can choose not to kill.
 - There's also an option to "choose not to kill" without any confrontation.
 - If player kills owner, gets a useful artifact, gets the species' law
   enforcement upset.
 - If player "proactively spares" owner, someone shows up and gives player the
   artifact.

The Pit
 - This is an area where the ship visually appears to move but its coords don't
   change like they should.
 - There's nothing in the center until the player has the right device and
   turns it on. Then there's some way to enter.
 - Things get interesting when the player turns the device off while inside...

Interstellar law prohibits expansion, but one race is trying to break the
 rules. The player can choose to help by finding colonizable planets or expose.
 - If the player helps, there are monetary rewards for finding planets with
   certain properties. The Luesheen will know the player is helping. When they
   confront the player about it, the player has the option of pointing out that
   the Clinkltook won't be able to use the information anyway.
 - If the player exposes, there's a big lump sum reward and maybe some
   technology. Maybe it also affects the circumstances of the final battles. Or
   maybe not. The lump sum might need to be very large to compete with the
   money the Clinkltook will give for planet info.

Two races vie for the same system.
 - Somehow this quest insures that the player is equipped to take the pirate
   base.
 - One race has no other nearby system.
 - The other has several but this one is the best.
 - When player learns of the problem, can go to Luesheen for advice.
 - Luesheen ambassador has gone missing.
 - Luesheen ask player for a favor. Talk to the race with more choices and
   offer plans for tech to alter the environment on their 2nd best planet,
   which is in another system. <=== Not using this idea

When Ssh learn of the terraforming tech, they ask the player if he can get
 another copy built. <=== Not using this idea
 - Player gets copy built
 - Person who builds it is pressured by Fenderit to build WMD instead
 - Player delivers it
 - This is the device that wipes out Ssh.

Missing ambassador
 - Pirates have taken him for ransom.
 - Luesheen refused to pay, so the pirates have killed him.
 - Luesheen ask player to retrieve the ship.
 - Advise player that they need to bring materials they can use to rebuild base
   armaments and personnel to run the base. Otherwise pirates will take it over
   again.
 - Big fight at pirate base with help from Luesheen.
 - Choxx will make noise about an attack on their territory, but when it's
   pointed out that Choxx outlaws abducted the frickin ambassador, and by the
   way what did Choxx authorities ever do to take care of those pirates, their
   protests reduce to empty face-saving threats, including something about
   you're the one with the candy shell. And of course, "Are you talking?"
 - Pirate base is left available for player to occupy.
 - Ambassador's ship can auto-pilot home.

There's a being who was rotated through 4 dimensions, so its intersection with
3-d space has 0 mass, and so it is moving through space at the speed of light.
Someone, probably the Luesheen, tells the player about the being and provides
some sort of "holographic capture device" or something that makes the player
able to catch and interact with the being.
 - Maybe the player takes the being back to the Luesheen, who are able to
   restore the being.
 - The being turns out to be a Dweenle.
 - No time has passed for the being. Its last memory was being depressed and
   doing something depressing, when some strange disturbance came through and
   caused the transformation. The Dweenle is certain it's going to die so
   whatever.
 - Somehow it comes out that the Dweenle isn't all that interested in learning
   whether it's dead or alive. Because what's the difference?
 - The Dweenle will join your crew and give a bonus to scanning.

The Fecto want you to be yourself. That's all they tell you. After you
interact with some other species, when you come back they ask you if you've
been yourself. You can say yes, say no, lie yes, or lie no. No matter what you
say, they find a way to turn it around into a "yes" and they give you
something. (What do they give you?)

If player gets ship for AI, distress call at some point from pirate attack.

Other distress calls
 - Pirate ambush
 - Soom Fenderit needs help but won't say what or what went wrong. It has a
   delivery for the Fenderit authorities. It's an encrypted communique. The
   Kee Pensette can decrypt it but not without the Fenderit finding out (if
   they ever receive the communique). Turns out the message is a recipe for
   something called Brundle Fly Surprise. (Come up with a better idea?)
 - Choxx party bus has a flat tire. "Flat tire? In space?" "Shut up, fag."
   Choxx will pay for help with repairs. There are prostitutes on board who
   will pay for passage to a starbase.
 - Unmanned vessel selling something stupid, won't shut up. If the player
   destroys the vessel, player finds some nice goodies and also gets a reward
   from Ssh, who were sick of that bullshit. Distress call repeats until that
   vessel is destroyed. Then faux game ending indicating victory.
 - A Clinkltook ship's reactor is losing stability. The ship is destroyed when
   the player arrives. There is some material to be salvaged
   in this case. There's a useful piece of equipment here too. If the player
   returns it to the Clinkltook, they show some kind of gratitude.
 - A Kee Pensette ship is lost near a nexus of continuum fluxes. Their
   instruments are damaged and they don't know which one leads home.
 - A Choxx beer "truck" has somehow "crashed" in interstellar space. They need
   repairs and help gathering the containers strewn about the vicinity. They
   think they're missing 8 but they're missing 9. If the player finds the 9th
   s/he has choice of handing it over or keeping it. If s/he hands it over s/he
   gets a thank you. If s/he keeps it s/he can sell it at the Choxx homeworld
   for a substantial price.
 - Derelict vessel full of corpses. Hull breach and the ship is open to space.
   Looks like the work of a pirate attack. Nothing salvageable. A personal log
   contains ciphered information about the location of something cool. This is
   a puzzle for the player.
 - A ship is out of fuel. When the player shows up, they say, "Oh hey. Usually
   Mel answers our calls."
 - A lone alien is floating in a spacesuit with no ship around, far from its
   home territory. The alien is unconscious. The player takes the alien on
   board to be returned to its homeworld, but it mysteriously disappears.
   Cause? It leaves some trinket behind.
 - Distress calls from base when it's under attack.

At some point in the game, Choxx tells player s/he "talks like a fag".

On the far side of Soom Fenderit space, in the "hinterlands", there is a being
that ends up being called The Nameless One.
 - The player will be told to stay away from that area of space by the
   Fenderit. S/he can't enter that region of space without a very tough fight.
 - A neighbor of the Fenderit knows of some sneaky way in.
 - Once inside, the Nameless One contacts the player and tells of the situation
   with the Fenderit.
 - The neighbor will refer the player to the Luesheen.
 - The Luesheen send the player to the Soom Fenderit homeworld, asking the
   player to do it as a favor. If the ambassador/starbase quest is complete,
   the Luesheen refer to the player as an honorary ambassador.
 - The Fenderit claim the Nameless One is a liar, terribly dangerous, and
   mustn't be allowed to communicate freely with others. It'll trick other
   species into waging war with each other, so they claim.
 - The player is then free to help the Nameless One expand its signal range.
 - It turns out the Nameless One has been around for millions of years. It
   doesn't know what's been happening for the last few thousand because the
   Fenderit clamped down on it as soon as contact was made. It does know about
   the Endurium beings, and this knowledge changes the region's economy. The
   player's claims about endurium are met with disbelief, except by the Kee
   Pensette, who accept the claims as an explanation of their own experiences
   with endurium. <====== Not using this idea.

////////////////////////////////////////

Induction Beings
 - Kee Pensette (This is what the Luesheen call them. It means "vibrating
                 friends". It suggests their rather electromagnetic
                 nature.)
 - Their world orbits a pulsar
 - Live on changes in magnetic flux
 - Made from semiconductors and metals, with maybe bio-squishy stuff for things
   that minerals can't do
 - They're naturally sessile but figured out how to use machines to move
   around. That was their big mobile revolution a couple thousand years before
   they became spacefaring.
 - They can sense from radio all the way up into X-rays.
 - Their hearing isn't very good.
 - They smell spectroscopically. They don't distinguish between odor and color
   as strongly as we do.
 - They see visible light roughly like we do.
 - Their ships radiate unusually for aesthetic reasons.
 - They don't use endurium because they can't stand the "sound" when it's used
   as fuel.
 - They're eusocial.
 - Their ships fire powerfully but charge slowly.
 - They reproduce by falling apart, merging gooies with each other, splitting
   apart, cocooning, then emerging.
 - They don't really do humor.
 - Their ships have long-range beam weaponry and are the most powerful of the
   minor species.
 - Their answer to the great question: We're here because we ask why we're
   here. The question itself is God and we worship curiosity -- not *with*
   curiosity, but curiosity *itself*.
 - They don't think about their own esteem.
 - They find the Clinkltooks' general trepidation a bit annoying, but they're
   also impressed with their courage, because they understand the Clinkltook
   can't help being afraid of other species.
 - They have a good relationship with the Luesheen, partly out of fascination
   about the mystery of their appearance (the notion of privacy is unnatural
   for them), partly out of respect for their unity despite not being built for
   eusociality, and also simply because the Luesheen are really nice.
 - They dislike the Soom Fenderit because their constant in-fighting rubs
   them the wrong way, but they tolerate them.
 - They're distrustful of Ssh because they can't imagine how such a motley
   bunch can work together so well. They must be hiding something. They like
   Ssh but don't want to.
 - They're totally perplexed by the Choxx but don't care to think about it
   much.
 - They're cool with the Fecto.
 - They sympathize with the Ixquaplorn but don't empathize.
 - They like the player alright as long as s/he isn't a dick.

Amphibians in the form of mats of turf
 - Clinkltook
 - They're low on the food chain.
 - Their style is defensive, a little paranoid.
 - Their ships are tough and fast but don't hit hard.
 - They're interested in the idea of a fine line between safety and tragedy.
 - Their primary themes in humor involve perforation and getting wet.
 - This stuff comes from their use of a hydrophobic layer they use to enhance
   surface tension when they're on the water.
 - Great question: The question is a meaningless tautology.
 - They think they're the sanest species around. Everyone else seems incredibly
   foolhardy.
 - They admire Kee Pensette very much because the whole EM-light-energy thing
   strikes them as godlike. This is despite their understanding of the science
   behind it.
 - They find the Luesheen to be a bit self-important but respect their good
   nature.
 - They're afraid of the Soom Fenderit, who manipulate the Clinkltook with
   veiled threats. The Luesheen try to tell them to stand up for themselves,
   assuring them the Luesheen would never let the Fenderit harm them, but they
   take some offense at that advice: it's awfully easy for a powerful species
   like the Luesheen to say "Stand up for yourselves".
 - They like Ssh the most because Ssh know pain and fear but remain positive.
   It also helps that they're unable to wage war and are thus no threat.
 - They positively hate the Choxx for obvious reasons.
 - The Fectos' teeth freak them out and strains their relationship, but they
   get along alright as long as they aren't in the same room.
 - They're puzzled by the somewhat haughty attitude of the Ixquaplorn but know
   how it is to feel distant from other species.
 - They get along alright with the player, but one misstep will ruin the
   relationship for the rest of the game.

Aliens inspired by the cold Scottish shore
 - Luesheen
 - They don't show their faces. Instead they transmit a cloudy, grey, pebbled
   beach.
 - They come across as melancholy.
 - They're loners by nature.
 - They're naturally isolationist but fight it. It shows up subtly in their
   behavior.
 - They see strength in solitude but are proud of their ability to work
   together. It's a hard-won ability that they developed proactively rather
   than out of a real need for survival. They are a benevolent power in this
   region.
 - They don't see more social races as better or worse. They respect any
   society's ability to retain harmony, however they manage it.
 - There is a character in the game who has seen them, but won't tell what they
   look like. This character is also good.
   "Alright, can you keep a secret?"
   "Yes."
   "So can I."
 - They will mention eating in the company of others. This is a joke they know
   the player won't understand. They always eat alone.
 - Great question: We gave up thinking about that long ago.
 - They insist on limits to expansion. They appreciate the importance of
   controlling more than one star system, but see unchecked exponential growth
   as unsustainable. They have a secret project to generate unlimited resources
   because they don't trust some other races to keep their cool, and they know
   it's only a matter of time before some huge expansionist dickhead comes
   along to spoil the party. Eventually, when they have perfected the
   technology, they plan to share it. This is The Pit. They explain all this
   stuff to the player if she finds the truth.
 - They're proud of themselves but do their best to be humble.
 - They love the Kee Pensette. They have a centuries-long friendship and find
   great beauty in their pensive and eusocial nature.
 - They find the Soom Fenderit distasteful but keep as close a relationship
   with them as possible for two reasons: maximize mutual trust for the purpose
   of knowing the deepest possible details about them, and maximize the
   positivity of their relationship.
 - They're quite concerned for Ssh. Ssh are vulnerable and they consider their
   outward positivity to be partially a front for inner turmoil considering
   their difficult past. The Luesheen feel very protective of Ssh. They won't
   let the Choxx pick on them, but they don't do much about Choxx pirates
   because the Choxx protect them, and the Luesheen don't see it as
   sufficient casus belli. The Luesheen
   are wise but they must tolerate some bad behavior in order to keep the
   region stable in a greater sense.
 - They can't help but laugh at the Choxx. They know it's a bit offensive to
   the other races because the Choxx tend to cause trouble and fear among the
   minor races, and they know it's mean to look down on another species, so
   they hide it as well as they can, but they find the Choxx to be pathetic to
   the point of hilarity.
 - They get along alright with the Fecto.
 - They don't try very hard to make friends with the Ixquaplorn.
 - They size up the player and immediately decide s/he's likeable but not to be
   trifled with.

The Seers
 - Soom Fenderit
 - These are the ones who end up being assholes.
 - They are rivals of the Luesheen but the peace is easy, mostly because they'd
   never hold up in a fight against the Luesheen. They aren't really sane
   enough to function as efficiently.
 - Blue-grey, kind of like bipedal rhinoceroses with beaks.
 - They're a bit douche-y.
 - They claim to be the first race in this region, but of course that's a lie.
   They actually wiped out or subsumed everyone, then hunkered down.
 - Great question: General distaste for philosophy.
 - When the Luesheen discovered FTL, the Fenderit Soom were peaceful but
   manipulated them in the interest of holding them back technologically.
   Luesheen eventually got wise. They're canny and long-lived so they were able
   to play a long con against the Fenderit Soom, developing technology in
   secret until they were in a position to stand up for themselves. The
   Fenderit Soom were surprised but remain prepared for bad things to happen,
   and felt confident when they declared total war on the Luesheen. They were
   no match for the Luesheen because they were sloppy in their execution. They
   wasted a lot of energy on internal squabbling and the Luesheen were focused
   on their purpose. Also, the Luesheen were very adept at hiding their plans
   and capabilities. In a bargain for their existence (the Luesheen were
   bluffing, would never wipe out another species), the Fenderit Soom agreed to
   the non-expansion treaty that stands to this day. This all happened many
   centuries ago.
 - They're too busy in-fighting to think about self-esteem.
 - They hate the Kee Pensette because they're jealous of their beauty, and are
   frustrated with their inability to manipulate this minor race.
 - They would hate the Luesheen if the Luesheen weren't so powerful, but they
   don't allow it because they don't want conflict: deep down they're afraid of
   the Luesheen. Instead they get nervous around the Luesheen and hide it with
   the appearance of veiled disrespect.
 - They laugh at Ssh but don't bother them because they consider Ssh not worth
   the time.
 - They get along with the Choxx because it's easy to manipulate them. The
   Choxx don't even realize it's happening. The Fenderit have absolutely no
   respect for the Choxx.
 - The Fecto creep them out. The best players among the Fenderit successfully
   manipulate the Fecto, but others don't try.
 - Currently in a truce with the Ixquaplorn. They try to make it sound like
   they've shown them mercy, but it's really because the Ixquaplorn are much
   better strategists than the Fenderit.
 - They underestimate the player.

The Cooperative
 - Ssh
 - From an alternate reality, so they say.
 - They're actually from the far future, they just don't realize it.
 - They talk about there being no binary systems in their vicinity. "We miss
   binary systems."
 - They just appeared in the region.
 - They're just rebuilding. They consider readying their escape device their
   first priority. This takes years to accomplish.
 - Great question: Everything that doesn't preclude itself exists.
 - They will pay player to help.
 - They refuse free help out of pride.
 - Their humor is similar to humans'.
 - They have a single orbital station. It's their sole interplanetary presence.
   It's boldly colored because the Fecto painted it as a sign of friendship.
 - They envy the Kee Pensette. They say so openly but also make it clear that
   they bear them no ill will. It's a friendly kind of jealousy.
 - They really want to trust the Luesheen. They don't understand why the
   Luesheen don't just go ahead and wipe out the Choxx pirates.
 - They *venomously detest* the Soom Fenderit. This doesn't translate to
   violent ideation, though. They can't put their finger on why their feelings
   are so strong.
 - They resent the occasional mistreatment they suffer from Choxx pirates,
   against whom they're powerless. They would destroy any and every Choxx
   vessel on sight if they could.
 - They don't know what to make of the Fecto but trust them without knowing
   exactly why.
 - They don't try very hard to make friends with the Ixquaplorn.
 - They're careful with the player but warm to his/her story of finding
   oneself alone in a strange place.

Expansionists
 - Choxx
 - Big wrinkly balls with snouts sticking out all over -- no symmetry.
 - Not really warlike but they are kinda pushy.
 - Easily offended.
 - Disgusted by weakness.
 - Internal armed conflict over which sports team is better.
   - They have only one.
   - It's called "You're My Bitch".
   - Kicking each other's asses is their version of sports commentary.
 - At some point they will demand the player say which team is
   better. No matter how the player chooses, the Choxx attack.
 - Use "fag" and "gay" and "retard". They talk in brospeak.
 - Constant references to ovipositors.
 - Hey bro, got any bitches on that ship with fat ovipositors? Love me some fat
   ovipositors.
 - Look up how immature kids talk nasty shit in online games.
 - Pirates are mostly Choxx and mostly appear near Choxx territory. Their base
   is in Choxx territory.
 - Even though they're assholes, they get sentimental when Ssh are destroyed.
 - Ships scan like jacked-up pickup trucks.
 - Pirate ships scan like pirate ships.
 - Great question: Ovipositors
 - They're too insensitive to think consciously in terms of self-esteem, but
   down deep they feel insecure. They can see that other races are using their
   brains more effectively.
 - They don't think much about Kee Pensette. Not interested either way.
 - They find the Luesheen frustrating, always ruining their fun. Bunch of fags
   and pussies.
 - They're cronies of the Soom Fenderit and do whatever they say. They profit
   greatly from this relationship.
 - They find Ssh pathetic and laughable. They can't help but want to push Ssh
   around.
 - They're freaked out by the Fecto, don't want anything to do with them.
 - They used to bother the Ixquaplorn but leave them alone now.
 - They laugh at the player and try to destroy him/her. When that doesn't work
   out, they either hate the shit out of the player, or start wanting to be
   bro-pals with them, depending on how badly they got beaten. If they interact
   with the player enough, they eventually find the player tedious.

Frog-wetas
 - Fecto
 - Quadrupeds shaped a bit like big wetas
 - Bumpy, bumps have neon yellow caps, cobalt blue background
 - Long sharp teeth
 - No recognizable eyes
 - Creepy and weird but amiable (they're actually pretty decent people)
 - Their central humor theme is about their poison -- leaking, too watery,
   delicious. They also think less colorful beings are hilarious.
 - They ask what color human blood is. When told it's red, they're very
   impressed. If the player lies and says it's colorless, they apologize in
   case the player is offended. They're a bit mortified. If the player lies
   and claims some other color, they have trouble believing it because we have
   a pinkish cast. "We don't buy it. What color is it really? Or maybe you
   don't want to talk about it."
 - They're very interested in ecologies with life that's brightly colored but
   not poisonous.
 - Great question: Their answer to the player is a bunch of weird psychedelic
   shit that doesn't sound like much of anything at all.
 - Their thoughts about themselves are not really expressible to others.
 - They're fascinated by the Kee Pensette just because they're so different.
   They get along alright.
 - They think the Luesheen won't show themselves because they're transparent
   and ashamed of it. Don't the Luesheen see there's nothing to be ashamed of?
 - They feel really bad for the Soom Fenderit. They must be really confused and
   desperate if they make factions, factions that aren't even based on color.
 - They don't understand the idea of being "creeped out". They don't take it
   personally when other species avoid them. They actually take it as a sign of
   respect. They instinctively feel that being left alone is recognition of
   their defensive capabilities.
 - They're fascinated by Ssh. So many different kinds of beings all living
   together! They also feel bad for them. Their colors are many but the
   boldness of those colors is inconsistent and that makes them seem extra
   vulnerable to the Fecto. They're also truly vulnerable. The Fecto painted
   the Ssh orbital station.
 - They're irresistibly attracted (not sexually, just... attracted) to the
   Choxx. They can't explain why in terms anyone else understands.
 - They have a very close relationship with the Ixquaplorn simply because the
   Ixquaplorn have been so nice to them. Their feelings about the Ixquaplorn
   don't translate to human emotions.
 - They think the player is funny -- a lone, plainly colored ship reminds them
   instinctively of a hopelessly incompetent predator.

Hammerhead Humanoids
 - Ixquaplorn
 - Red skin, hammerheads
 - Big, pretty eyes, not unlike those huge doll heads in Star Trek IV
 - They're very understandable, like Ssh.
 - They eat their own poop, like rabbits.
 - Not very tolerant of people's differences. They can have good professional
   relationships with other species but are otherwise standoffish.
 - Great question: They reference an Ultimate Cause that is its own cause.
 - They think of themselves as pretty okay.
 - They find the Kee Pensette a bit tiresome for being so... Pensette-y.
 - They also find the Clinkltook tiresome for being so cautious.
 - They roll their eyes at the Luesheen, who seem really self-important to
   them.
 - Currently in a truce with the Soom Fenderit. They accept their differences
   with the Fenderit as one of the vagaries of interspecies relationships.
 - They don't trust Ssh. Such a mismatched group of beings seems sketchy to
   them.
 - They have a hostile relationship with the Choxx.
 - They have a very close relationship with the Fecto because the whole freaky
   cryptic thing is refreshing.
 - They get along alright with the player but consider him/her a busybody.

Widely Distributed Incorporeal Intelligence
 - Has no name. Tells the player s/he can refer to it as The Nameless One.
 - Emergent intelligence resulting from a number of communication nodes
   scattered around several star systems.
 - The nodes are absolutely indestructible and look artificial.
 - To be found when the player wanders into the hinterlands.
 - Soom Fenderit know about it due to proximity, but hide its existence from
   other species. They do this purely because they want control.
 - It wants to communicate with other species in the region but needs help
   expanding the range of its signals.
 - It turns out the Fenderit are jamming them.
 - There's a quest involving freeing this being.
 - Great question: They agree with the Clinkltook. The question is like asking,
   "Why is the great question 'Why'?"

Rock Fruit
 - Guoip-Hlosh
 - Mobile "fruit" of sessile beings that grow from rocks
 - Hermaphrodites
 - Sessile stage is extremely hardy. They have leaves like succulents, only
   tougher.
 - They wander far in their "spore" stage. This is their intelligent stage.
 - They metamorph into their "adult" stage in which they bind with a rock
   surface and develop a thorny shell. Inside the shell, they bore into the
   rock and germinate.
 - Spore stage is built for travel. Legs like a hare with long forelimbs. All
   hands/feet can extrude gecko-type surface for climbing rock. Built flexible
   and lithe like cats. Webbed limbs for gliding.
 - Omnivorous. Short hair like tarantula abdomens or the micro-barbed stuff
   some cactuses have. Heads like sloths.
 - They prefer to bind with other adults but will take root alone if necessary.
 - They became intelligent when they developed the ability to communicate with
   others they found, learning about good areas to germinate. Then they started
   using tools to treat rock surfaces, making more surfaces viable for
   germination.
 - Why bother with soil if you can go find a rock that's relatively hard to get
   to?
 - Their answer to the big question is, "Why not?"
 - Their joke: "Why shouldn't you bind with a lawyer? You'll slide off in the
   rain."

Heat flux per area j
j = σT(H)^4 / 2   (divide by about 2 because half the planet is
